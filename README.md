# Syntactic Processing - Identify Treatment - Health domain
> ‘BeHealthy’ has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online.
So, companies like ‘BeHealthy’ are providing medical services, prescriptions and online consultations and generating huge data day by day.

## General Information
### Problem statement
> Suppose you have been given such a data set in which a lot of text is written related to the medical domain. As you can see in the dataset, there are a lot of diseases that can be mentioned in the entire dataset and their related treatments are also mentioned implicitly in the text, which you saw in the aforementioned example that the disease mentioned is cancer and its treatment can be identified as chemotherapy using the sentence.
But, note that it is not explicitly mentioned in the dataset about the diseases and their treatment, but somehow, you can build an algorithm to map the diseases and their respective treatment.
Suppose you have been asked to determine the disease name and its probable treatment from the dataset and list it out in the form of a table or a dictionary like this.

## Steps
Below steps needs to be completed:

* Data preprocessing
* Concept identification
* Defining the features for CRF
* Getting the features words and sentences
* Defining input and target variables
* Building the model
* Evaluating the model
* Identifying the diseases and predicted treatment using a custom NER
